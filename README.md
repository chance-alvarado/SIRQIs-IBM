### How SIRQIs Works <a name="introduction"></a>

### Installation/ Requirements <a name="setup"></a>

SIRQIs is an individual-based model of disease developed completely in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Since disease and interaction dynamics are enacted at the individual-level across large batches of simulations **ensure you have proper computational resources and time**. SIRQIs will also automatically produce many results files when run. **Be sure to have ample storage on your device to store simulation results**. Download or clone this repository [here](https://github.com/chance-alvarado/SIRQIs-IBM).

The contents of this repository were written and have been tested with [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/). SIRQIs makes used of the follwoing standard libraries:

Library | 
--------|
[csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) | 
[glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) | 
[os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) |
[shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) |
[sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) | 
[importlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html) |

Additional modules needed for proper function are listed below:

Requirement | Version |
------------|---------|
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) | 3.1.3
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) | 1.18.1 | 
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) | 1.0.1
[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) | 1.4.1
